<p>Hi. This is the personal website of John Akwei, ECMp ERMp Data Scientist. My first website was published back in 2003. The address was then, www.johnakwei1.com. I paid $80/year to host that website through its many iterations, from all-HTML with tables, to a new home page with CSS.<p>

<p>Finally, after taking a one year Data Science Specialization course, from Johns Hopkins University / Coursera, I had enough Github skills to publish an all new website, johnakwei.github.io, for free as a service that is included in my public github account. Some persons might recognize the title banner, and some of the certificates, from my old website. Everything else is new.<p>

<p>I started in Website Design with Microsoft FrontPage in the late 1990s. My interactive computer multimedia experience goes back to Hypercard with an Apple Macintosh, in the late 1980s. By the time I got around to authoring this website, I had developed the ability to hand code a website with only Wordpad, a Web Browser, and a single folder holding all the website files. When you click on a file in the folder, and select "View in Browser", the Website is then locally hosted, allowing for a interactive design process.</p>
	
<p>I have many years of experience managing full-cycle Data Science projects including defining key business objectives, designing research methods, analyzing data, and presenting findings. My strategy of solving business problems combines analytical reasoning with a practical understanding of what clients are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>I have knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, distributions, statistical tests, etc.). I have also created model documentation, validation, testing and data source connectivity.</p>

<p>My many Data Science accomplishments include being published by Analytics Vidhya, posting leading R language solutions to kaggle.com competitions, and completing many projects for clients including: Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, K-Means/KNN Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Webscraping, and Data Application Development.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your interest! I hope you enjoy looking around my personal website!</p>
